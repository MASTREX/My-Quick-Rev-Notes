## OOPs
- On object creation, instance variables are assigned default values of the data type.
- Default constructor is only created only when there is a variable which is not initialised.
- non-static class is not loaded into memory until it is used for first time.
- The `protected` access modifier cannot be applied to classes and interfaces.
